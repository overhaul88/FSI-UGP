# Problem Statement

Is it possible to extract real physical insights about fluid flow mechanisms by analyzing simulation data? Simulations produce data based on programmed physical laws - They generate results by exploring scenarios within these modeled laws? Can they reveal information about parameters we haven't explicitly modeled? This would require building a pipeline that uses existing theoretical models to develop new coherent ones. 

I want to use the concepts of Artificial Intelligence to attempt to explain the observations found in this given Research study. I have the experimental setup description and the entire CFD simulations dataset. Generate the exhaustive procedure to do so. Given below is the research description and the UNEXPLAINED OBSERVATIONS that need to be explained using the techniques. Build such a solution structure that would attempt to explain these UNEXPLAINED OBSERVATIONS.

Research Description
This study investigates the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of two flexible filaments placed
side by side in a crossflow, separated by a gap d = 0.5L, where L is the length of the
filaments. The system is governed by several key non-dimensional parameters, including
the Reynolds number (Re), the mass ratio (m∗
), the reduced speed (UP ), the structural
damping (ζ), and the Poisson ratio (νs), which control the coupled dynamics of the flow
and the vibrations of the filaments. The calculations are carried out at a fixed Reynolds
number of Re = 80, ensuring unstable flow dynamics while remaining within the range
where the flow does not transition to three-dimensionality. The Reynolds number is defined
as Re = UL/νf , where U is the free-stream velocity and νf is the kinematic viscosity of
the fluid.
The reduced speed, UP , is varied by altering the stiffness of the filaments, allowing exploration of the system’s behavior across a range of flexibility. The mass ratio m∗
, which
quantifies the relative inertia of the structure compared to the mass of the displaced fluid,
is varied across the values m∗ = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. To compare results across varying

which effectively normalizes flexibility and provides a unified framework for analyzing the
coupled dynamics.

In previous work, we identified a phenomenon referred to as the Synchronous Regime,
where the filaments exhibited coupled periodic behavior, leading to a distinct vortex shedding pattern. Upon further investigation, we now redefine this behavior as the In-phase
Vortex Shedding Regime, characterized by a specific vortex shedding pattern unique 

to this flow condition. This updated terminology aligns more precisely with the findings
of Williamson (1965), who first described the in-phase vortex shedding behavior in his
studies on wake evolution behind pairs of bluff bodies. Figure 3.2 illustrates the idealized
vortex shedding patterns for both anti-phase and in-phase shedding regimes.
A partitioned approach is employed to simultaneously solve the governing flow equations
and the structural dynamics of the filaments. The flow is modeled using a stabilized finite
element method with linear interpolation for velocity and pressure, while the structural
dynamics are modeled using the Timoshenko beam theory. Structural damping is neglected
(ζ = 0), and Poisson’s ratio (νs) is set to 0.3. The filament material is lumped along
their centerlines for the structural model, and the thickness is assumed to be negligible

for the flow analysis. Temporal integration is performed using the Bathe time integration
method for structural equations and a conservative scheme for the flow equations, ensuring
robust solutions for vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) across a wide range of UP . The
computational domain is initialized with fully developed unsteady flow past undeformed
filaments, using a time step of ∆t = 0.025.
The parametric space, though extensive, is focused on regions of interest identified from
prior studies. For instance, previous research demonstrated that when the gap between
filaments is d = 3L, the filaments behave independently, whereas at d = 0.5L, significant
wake interactions are observed. Given the inherent bistability at d = 0.5L, this configuration is chosen to explore how variations in the mass ratio (m∗
) and flexibility (UP /SB)
influence the coupled flow dynamics. This study aims to classify the resulting flow behaviors into distinct regimes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the impact of these
parameters on flow-structure interactions.

UNEXPLAINED OBSERVATIONS:

For m∗ = 100(Heavy mass ratios) , exceptionally high vibration amplitudes are observed. Heavy mass ratios did not exhibit in-phase vortex shedding, and filament vibrations were dictated by the natural frequency. At m∗ = 100, exceptionally large deflections were observed, resulting in mesh entanglement and computational breakdown. The lack of in-phase vortex shedding in heavy mass regimes highlights the decoupling of flow and structural dynamics, with large deflections driving the system’s response. There is no explanation for why this is happening.

## 1. Problem Setup: Heavy Filaments in Crossflow

### 1.1 Physical Scenario

1. **Geometry**
    - Imagine a long, slender **flexible filament** (like a thin rod or a cantilevered beam) placed in a **steady crossflow**. The upstream flow velocity is U∞ (or a dimensionless version of it), and the filament is oriented so that the flow is perpendicular to its axis.
        
        U∞U_\infty
        
2. **Mass Ratio** (m∗)(m^*)(m∗)
    - This is a dimensionless parameter comparing the filament’s structural mass (per unit length) to the mass of the displaced fluid (per unit length).
    - **Given Cases**:
        - m∗=50m^*=50m∗=50 (relatively lighter in the “heavy” range),
        - m∗=100m^*=100m∗=100 (significantly heavier).
    - Physically, a higher m∗ means the filament’s inertia dominates over the fluid’s mass influence.
        
        m∗m^*
        
3. **Bending Stiffness** (SB)(S_B)(SB)
    - A **dimensionless** measure combining the filament’s Young’s modulus (or flexural rigidity), length scale, and the fluid’s inertial scale.
    - **Ranges**:
        - **Low** (SB<1): The filament is very flexible, easily bent by the flow.
            
            (SB<1)(S_B<1)
            
        - **Transition** (SB≈3.5): Observed shift in dynamics.
            
            (SB≈3.5)(S_B\approx 3.5)
            
        - **High** (SB>4): The filament is stiff, less prone to flow-induced bending.
            
            (SB>4)(S_B>4)
            
4. **Frequencies**
    - Fnatural\mathbf{F_\mathrm{natural}}Fnatural: The filament’s **structural natural frequency** (if there were no flow).
    - Fvs\mathbf{F_\mathrm{vs}}Fvs: The **vortex shedding frequency** determined by the flow (like the Strouhal frequency in cylinder wakes).
    - F\mathbf{F}F: The **actual response frequency** of the filament’s oscillations once the fluid forces are considered.
5. **Flow Conditions**
    - The flow can be **laminar** or **turbulent** depending on the Reynolds number.
    - Vortex shedding typically arises at moderate or high Reynolds numbers, imparting periodic forcing on the filament.

### 1.2 Key Observations in the Problem

1. **Frequency Alignment**
    - **For SB<1S_B<1SB<1**: F≈Fnatural for both m∗=50 and m∗=100.
        
        F≈Fnatural\mathbf{F}\approx\mathbf{F_\mathrm{natural}}
        
        m∗=50m^*=50
        
        m∗=100m^*=100
        
    - **Around SB≈3.5S_B\approx3.5SB≈3.5**:
        - m∗=50m^*=50m∗=50: F **shifts** or “locks in” closer to Fvs.
            
            F\mathbf{F}
            
            Fvs\mathbf{F_\mathrm{vs}}
            
        - m∗=100m^*=100m∗=100: F remains near Fnatural.
            
            F\mathbf{F}
            
            Fnatural\mathbf{F_\mathrm{natural}}
            
    - **For SB>4S_B>4SB>4**: Both return to F≈Fnatural.
        
        F≈Fnatural\mathbf{F}\approx\mathbf{F_\mathrm{natural}}
        
2. **Vortex Shedding Influence**
    - **Lighter Filament (m∗=50m^*=50m∗=50)**: Fvs can approach F in the transition zone (SB≈3.5), indicating strong flow-structure coupling.
        
        Fvs\mathbf{F_\mathrm{vs}}
        
        F\mathbf{F}
        
        SB≈3.5S_B\approx3.5
        
    - **Heavier Filament (m∗=100m^*=100m∗=100)**: Fvs does not match F across all SB, suggesting minimal coupling.
        
        Fvs\mathbf{F_\mathrm{vs}}
        
        F\mathbf{F}
        
        SBS_B
        
3. **Amplitude Trends**
    - m∗=50\mathbf{m^*=50}m∗=50 → Larger deflections and higher vibration amplitudes.
    - m∗=100\mathbf{m^*=100}m∗=100 → Smaller deflections and more “structurally dominated” behavior.

By “explaining” these observations, we aim to elucidate **why** certain frequencies dominate and **how** the flow modifies the filament’s response under different stiffness and mass-ratio regimes.
